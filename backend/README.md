# Hot 100 Spotify Playlist

This is an embryonic schema of a project that will evolve into a more complete application. The current implementation creates a private Spotify playlist containing the Billboard Hot 100 songs for a specific week.

## Features

- Fetches Billboard Hot 100 data for a specified week.
- Creates a private Spotify playlist with the fetched songs.
- Simple FastAPI endpoint to trigger the playlist creation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8+
2. Spotify Developer Account
3. Spotify API Credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
4. Billboard Hot 100 access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-billboard-playlist-creator.git
cd spotify-billboard-playlist-creator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Spotify API credentials:

```
CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

To obtain these credentials, follow these steps:

- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
- Log in with your Spotify account.
- Click "Create an App" and follow the prompts.
- Once the app is created, you will see the Client ID and Client Secret.

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

```bash
GET /createPlaylist/2022:05:17
```

This will create a Spotify playlist with the Billboard Hot 100 songs for the week of May 17, 2022.
